  Julie Mitchell trained at The Central School of Art. It was Life Drawing there which inspired Julie's love for drawing, and now, painting and drawing.


  A fascination for the human form lead her into recognising the beauty and complexity of nature. Many of Julie's [Still Lives](/still-lifes/) feature found objects, branches, fronds leaves and seed pods. Sometimes their decaying shape is exquisite to depict in oil.


  The making of [Landscapes](/landscapes/)â€™ which have become so much part of her summer occupation - spending prolonged time in Tuscany which enabled Julie to be able to experiment with light and shade. The study of that, the deepest shadow which is created by an intense sun overhead has become a joy and preoccupation to make, oil on canvas, charcoal on paper.
