about: >-
  Julie Mitchell trained at The Central School of Art. It was Life Drawing there
  which inspired her love for drawing, and now, painting and drawing.


  A fascination for the human form lead her into recognising the beauty and complexity of nature. Many of her [Still Lives](/still-life) feature found objects, branches, fronds leaves and seed pods. Sometimes their decaying shape is exquisite to depict in oil.


  The making of [Landscapes](/landscapes)’ which have become so much part of my summer occupation as I’ve been fortunate to spend prolonged time in Italy which has meant that I have been able to experiment with light and shade. The study of that, the deepest shadow which is created by an intense sun overhead has become a joy and preoccupation to make, oil on canvas, charcoal on paper.
